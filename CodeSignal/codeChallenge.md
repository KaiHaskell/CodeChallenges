# Code readability, organization, and syntax.

Ability explain the underlying strategy used to solve the problem
Ability to assess the time and space complexity of your implementation
Ability to explain the rationale behind your analysis.
Here's how you might spend your time before the interview prepping for it:

# For each problem in your results pdf:

Review the prompt to re-familiarize yourself with the problem.
Re-familiarize yourself with your own implementation.

- Talk through what your code is doing at a high level, without consulting your code; find a non-programmer friend and talk them through the problem and how you solved it at a conceptual level until they understand your methodology. The goal here is to practice articulating through the strategy behind your code in order to convince someone else that you understand the underlying problem that your implementation is addressing. If you're just repeating your code back line by line, you're doing it wrong!
  If there are issues with your code, try to figure out what those issues are; be prepared to talk about them during your interview and have an answer prepared for the following:
  What caused this issue?
  How can we address it / fix it?
  Figure out the time and space complexities for your implementation, and be able to talk about why you think your solution exhibits those complexities.
  Ask yourself: what's the best possible time / space complexity for this problem?
  How does my implementation compare to ideal time / space complexity?
  What are some ways in which we could tweak / change my implementation to improve on its time / space complexity (assuming your implementation doesn't hit the ideal)?
