## Describing your Code in an Interview

Tips:

Pretend you already have the job and the interviewer is a coworker who came to you for help on a difficult problem

- If you already have the job, there's no stress
- Regrames the situation from an interview to just problem-solving
- Puts you in a cooperative mindset
- It forces you to _teach_ the problem and the solution

## UPER is the key to it all

UNDERSTAND

- Ask questions about the problem
- Dialog
- Rephrase the problem back to the interviewer in your own words

PLAN

- Come up with multiple plans, if possible
- Don't ignore the naive plan
- Teach the plan to the interviewer
- Think in big concepts, not in code

EXECUTE

- If you're describing existing code:

  - Interviewer will look for where the concepts match the blocks of code
  - Point out interesting things in it
  - Make sure it's well commented and looks good

- If you're writing new code:

* Interviewer will look for where the concepts match the blocks of code
* Actually code it up at this point

REFLECT

- What could have we done better?
- Future directions and features
- If you made any mistakes, point them out with solutions.
